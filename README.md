# COMP2018 Linux System Administration

## Course Information
This course is part of the CSTN and COPA programs at Georgian College. The course outline is updated periodically and kept available online via the [Georgian College website](https://georgiancollege.ca). There is also a course syllabus with the details for each semester kept on the [Blackboard website](https://gc.blackboard.com) for the course.
There is no textbook for this course. Online help and documentation provide the reference material.
Ubuntu Server 20.04LTS is the platform for our lab exercises and it is expected that students will run it in a virtual machine under [VMWare](https://vmware.com) ([Link to download Academic use licensed version](https://onthehub.com)), [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) which is free from Oracle, or [Parallels](https://parallels.com) which is a highly integrated Mac application that is not free. Students are expected to install and become familiar with at least one of these software packages on their own. I have published a short video on youtube on [how to download VMWare from onthehub.com using your student account](https://youtu.be/z__OjayPFXA).
